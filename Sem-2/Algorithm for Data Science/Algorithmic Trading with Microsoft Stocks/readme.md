Project Description:
a stock trading signal generator using advanced deep learning techniques. Specifically, you're
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers to predict stock
prices based on historical data and generate trading signals accordingly. By utilizing stock price
data from sources like Yahoo! Finance —such as Microsoft historical stock prices— we are using
advanced deep learning models to predict stock prices and generate trading signals. By properly
preparing the data and adjusting the model architecture, we're able to train a model that can learn
from historical patterns and make future predictions. The integration of LSTM and GRU layers
allows the model to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Proper data
normalization, sequence creation, and model tuning are crucial steps that contribute to the overall
performance of the predictive model.
